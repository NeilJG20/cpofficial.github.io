                            <p style="color:white">If you need the very best mouse and you need it now, we'll save you a bit of time. The Logitech MX Master 3 is our clear favourite â€“ at least if you're right-handed (there's no left-handed version, unfortunately). We find its ergonomic design makes it comfortable for all-day use. It has ample programmable buttons, not to mention a thumb wheel, which allows shortcut profiles to be setup for our favourite apps so we can blaze through repetitive tasks more quickly. </p>
                            <p style="color:white">We find the MX Master 3 tracks accurately on pretty much any surface we've tried it on, and 4,000 DPI will be plenty for most creatives. It charges for minutes over USB-C and should keep going for up to 70 days. Best of all you can connect it to several devices and switch between them instantly. You also get Logitech's Bolt wireless technology, which brings better reliability in crowded workspaces while bringing down latency.</p>

                            <p style="color:white">While the MX Master 3 is the best mouse for designers overall, it won't be to everybody's tastes; some may find it just a little too big and chunky, and that thumbwheel can feel like it's in the way if you're not making use of it. For a more compact and streamlined alternative perfect for taking with you wherever you go, the Logitech MX Anywhere 3 is just the ticket. Functionally, it's very similar to the MX Master (with the exception of the scroll wheel), and its simpler design makes it more suitable for use in either hand. </p>
                            <p style="color:white"> The only real downside is that it might be just a little too tiny for some. Designed with portability in mind, it comes in a bit smaller than the average desktop mouse and could prove to be just a little cramped for all-day use. If you have small hands, though, it should be the perfect fit and an ideal everyday option.</p>

Razer's best known for its gaming peripherals, but this one's aimed at a more general audience and the styling's been toned down to match. </p>
                            <p style="color:white">The Pro Click boasts an ergonomic design developed with Humanscale, as well as eight programmable buttons and an adjustable DPI that goes all the way up to 16,000, making it roughly ten times more sensitive than you're ever likely to need. This is a mouse that's designed to be used all day, and with a battery life of up to 400 hours it'll keep on going for weeks until you need to plug it in for a recharge. It's the most expensive option in our list of the best mouse options, but well worth paying extra for its superior ergonomics. </p>

That includes its fully customizable key actuation and dual-step key activation, which are both meant to help you rise to the top of the leaderboards. Letâ€™s not forget to mention Razerâ€™s latest Analog Optical Switches, which are the cream of the keyboard switches crop.</p>

                            <p style="color:white">Not only is this Cherry SX scissor-switch keyboard robust and affordable, but it also delivers a great performance and even greater comfort, making it a pleasure to use even though itâ€™s not exactly what youâ€™d call eye candy. The setup is breathtakingly easy as well, something many casual users will appreciate. You just need a single dongle to connect it and its matching mouse to your computer or laptop, which should free up some of those ports for other peripherals. Not all great things come in fancy, attractive packages.</p>

                            <p style="color:white">The Logitech MX Keys Mini is among the best keyboards in the mini keyboards market. Being not only compact but also thin and lightweight, it's just as ideal for travel and commutes, as it is for home use, which gives it that versatility many remote and hybrid workers are seeking these days. </p>
                            <p style="color:white">While it is wrapped in a compact package, we found it to deliver a pleasant typing experience during testing, with its keys ergonomically designed to keep your fingertips in place and feel tactile despite the lack of mechanical switches. It's robust as well â€“ the absence of any detectable scratches or bumps after a week of carting it around in our backpack is proof. And, naturally, since it is Logitech, there's a great system here for multi-device connectivity, allowing you to pair it with three devices at once and easily switch from one to the other on the fly.</p>
